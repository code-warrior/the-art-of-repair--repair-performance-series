* Its second life begins when the unit fails
* The repair may require a cosmetic alteration
* The repair may be invisible
* We can form a bond with the item after a repair, because we’ve invested our own time
* The bond will mean that we’ll likely keep the item for longer
* The item will likely spend most of its time in its second life
