I see items as having two lives.

The second life begins when the unit fails.

## Philosophical Perspective on Repairing Items

In this second life, we develop a new relationship with the item based on the repair required. Maybe the item required a physical modification for it to be opened; perhaps a switch needed to be replaced with one of a different size; or, maybe the item had to be modified for a replacement that is of a different size. Examples include:

* Using zip ties to seal a portable coffee mug’s base (image of Contigo mug)
* Replacing a switch that is not the same as the original (Intertek space heater)
* Using tape to reseal a shaver attachment that wouldn’t budge (Norelco shaver)

It’s in this phase that the item likely spends most of its life, as other parts fail and it requires more repairs. Think of an item as a car — the longer you own it, the more it will require repairs. Remember that the more you take care of that car, the fewer repairs it will require.
