## Resources

Here’s a pithy starter list of resources to guide you. This list will engender further resources as you go down the repair hole

* [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) for computer/mobile device repair guides and parts
* The [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) family of Q&A sites, including carpentry ([https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/](https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/)), bicycle maintenance ([https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/)), and arts and crafts ([https://crafts.stackexchange.com/](https://crafts.stackexchange.com/))
* Google, Bing, and Ecosia will all likely yield results when you search for the problem you’re having
* YouTube is also helpful when searching for solutions, as others likely have had the same problem
